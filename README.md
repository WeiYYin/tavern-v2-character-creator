# Tavern v2 Character Card Creator
**A simple character creator for Character Card Spec v2**

All the fun AI roleplay tools have 'tavern' in the name so mine will, too. Tv2CCC will prioritize compatibility with SillyTavern.

You can play with the app <a href="https://gaffe-buck.github.io/tavern-v2-character-creator/">**here**</a>. No warranty express or implied! I will not be responsible for the horrors you unleash on the world with it, either.
